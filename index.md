## About Me

![Image Of Me](/headshotLQ.jpg)

I am a patented inventor and researcher dedicated to productionizing life-saving innovations in mathematics and computer science on continuously deliverable IT service platforms. As an developer, I advocate for `systems engineering` approaches to problems. I am primarily interested developing highly engineered products that are suitable for _constraining regulatory environments_. I focus on the application domains of emergency response systems, healthcare delivery, and financial services. 

I have experience in a range of other fields including 
- embedded systems, 
- electromyography, 
- thermoplastics, 
- garment manufacturing, 
- business process improvement, and 
- automotive control systems. 

My research interests include 
1. optimization & operations research, 
2. online & optimal control systems, and 
3. chaos theory. 

While working for my current employer, Nakamura Partners, I created emergency response systems inventions that caused [US Patent No. 10,595,183](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10595183B2/) to be issued in the company's ownership (separate from and not affiliated with UCSD).

Outside of work or school, I enjoy surfing, skateboarding, and playing the guitar.
